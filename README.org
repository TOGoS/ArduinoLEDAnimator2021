#+TITLE: PowerCube

[2019-01-09]

The goal of this project is to create a framework for ESP8266-controlled
battery and light controllers.

If you want to basically throw all similar Arduino/ESP8266 projects in here
so they can share code more easily or whatever, that would probably be fine.

*** Desired sofware features

- WiFi repeater
  - Look into 
- Reporting via MQTT
- Display via I2C OLED screen
- Dynamic configuration over WiFi

- Play around with https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater for inspiration
- Look into using ENC28J60 for connecting to ethernet

*** Desired hardware features

- 3 power inputs that can be independently voltage-sampled and connected to Vbatt
  - 12V power supply
  - 12V external battery
  - 12V internal battery
  - 9V internal backup battery
- A ~12V output port
- OLED screen for showing status
